# Cybersecurity Home Lab Project #1
## Safe Environment Setup for Cybersecurity Testing

### 1. Purpose
To create a secure, isolated environment where cybersecurity tools and simulations can be run without risk to production systems.  

### 2. Tools Used
- VirtualBox (virtualization platform)  
- Kali Linux ISO (penetration testing OS, for simulation only)  

### 3. Procedure
1. Downloaded & installed VirtualBox.  
2. Configured VM settings to mimic a lightweight endpoint.  
3. Installed Kali Linux.  
4. Validated isolation (no impact to host system).  
5. Created baseline snapshots for rollback.  

### 4. Outcome
- Established a repeatable environment for safe testing.  
- Practiced foundational skills in virtualization, networking, and recovery.  

### 5. Lessons Learned
- Snapshots = critical for experimentation.  
- SOC teams rely on isolated labs for safe simulations.
